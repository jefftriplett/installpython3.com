# Linux

Python is usually installed by default on most modern Linux systems. To check what your currently have, open a terminal and run the following command (note the dollar sign `$` is the beginning of the prompt and should not be included!):

```
$ python --version
Python 3.7.5
```

If you see a version of Python starting with a 2, such as `Python 2.7.10`, then try the same command using `python3` instead of `python`:

```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.5
```

The latest version of Python is 3.8 (as of this writing) but generally 3.6+ will provide modern features, such as f-strings and async/await, that are widely used.

## Install Python 3.7
There are many ways to install Python but one of the simplest is to use [deadsnakes](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

Within your terminal enter the following three commands:

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install python3.7
```

This will install Python 3.7 and a new Python session can be started by typing `python3.7` from the terminal:

```
$ python3.7
>>>
```
